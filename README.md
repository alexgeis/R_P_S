# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This page is a rock, paper, scissors application w/ dynamic images and a scoreboard. A kitten vs. puppy showdown is shown on pageload and from there the user can play an infinite number of R/P/S games.

## Future Development

- API Integration for random images
- Storage of user scores (local or DB)
- CSS/JS Animations
- Winner/loser display improvement - more visuals around winners/losers. Specifically, some visual indicator to point to the winner (a large arrow in the middle, or something similar)
- Scoreboard styling - something akin to an actual scoreboard
- Implement a nodeJS/express backend server
- PWA conversion
- Deployment - ideally via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- Update responsiveness of main section - could stack more smoothly
